<p><b>Ciao everyone! My name is Ameer Kiani.</b> I moved to Seattle in April 2019. After working with several non-profit organizations and studying business administration, I have decided to make a career change. It may seem daunting at first to jump into a new field but I am excited for the new possibilities.</p>

<p>This is my second quarter here at SCC. So far, I find the web development track to be the most captivating. I previously used to run some websites and message boards in my teens so web development has always been a passion of mine. Some of my hobbies are learning about astrology, reading graphic novels (with my cat Fiona curled up on my lap), and dancing. </p>

<p>I am a Libra-Scorpio cusp so I am a passionate, honest person who is also searching for equality. I love researching new topics but can come across as a "know-it-all" or brutally honest, but that is not my intention. Pet peeves of mine are dishonesty and superficiality. </p>
