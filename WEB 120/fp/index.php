 <h2>About Hamza Kiani</h2>
    <p>Originally from Michigan, I was a Red Cross certified lifeguard for three summers in lovely Mackinac Island. I am a National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) certified personal trainer and have over a decade of experience in the fitness industry. I recently relocated to Seattle and am currently employed as an aquatic instructor for special needs children.</p>

<p>On my rare downtime, you can catch me at professional wrestling events cheering on the good guys and booing the bad guys.</p>
