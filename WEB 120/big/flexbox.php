<h2>Summary</h2>
		
        <p>CSS flexbox is a relatively new and powerful way to create a layout (Nick Schäferhoff 2020). Every web developer should learn how to use Flexbox. CSS Flexbox allows you to easily format HTML (Carnes 2019). It works by aligning items horizontally and vertically using rows and columns. Flexbox stands for flexible box (Nick Schäferhoff 2020). It gets the word flex by having the items “flex” to fill the space (Carnes 2019). Flexbox is its own CSS module, and not simply a property, so it has its own operators. Flexbox is not recommended to build your entire page, but instead used for  nav menus, card layouts and web forms (Nick Schäferhoff 2020). Flexbox works by having a flex container with children (flex items) which are placed along flex lines. All modern browsers support flexbox (Nick Schäferhoff 2020).</p>
        <p>Flexbox works by aligning items horizontally and vertically by rows and columns (Carnes 2019). It is easier for responsive web design and is great for your general layout of your website or app. Some flexbox properties are flex-direction, flex-wrap and flex-direction (Nick Schäferhoff 2020). Display: flex tells your browser to use flexbox in the container. Display: block is the default display and will have your divs lined up in columns. Display: flex will have the divs lined up in rows (Carnes 2019). You can then use flex-direction to have them lined up in columns or rows/. You can also use row-reverse or column-reverse to switch the order. You use justify-content to display how the items take up the space, either in the center, start or the end. There are many other flexbox properties (Carnes 2019). Although there are many ways to design a layout, flexbox is becoming more and more common for web developers. It is especially useful for smaller page elements, dynamic layouts and mobile design (Nick Schäferhoff 2020). There are flexbox games available to help users learn flexbox (Carnes 2019).</p>
