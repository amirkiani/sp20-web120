<h2>Summary</h2>
		
        <p>An e-commerce website allows you to decide what to sell, how to arrange them and the look of your design much like a physical store (Roth 2016). eCommerce platforms allow you to build an online store from scratch, sell your products or services, and even manage marketing tasks like sending email announcements. All good eCommerce platforms let you build your online store from the ground up, starting with store design (Roth 2016). Shopping cart software are systems developed to serve as order catalogues for order stores (Chang 2020). In most cases, shopping carts act as the interface between the store’s front end and back end, making it possible for customers to choose products/services, read the description and reviews of what they’ve chosen, add/edit settings, and make a purchase (Chang 2020). Shopping carts, also known as e-commerce website software programs, can be a complicated purchase for businesses (Chang 2020). </p>
        <p>But if it's your first time building an online store, you'll want something with an easy-to-use interface. Overall, these are the vital features  which allow you to:</p>
<ul><p><li>Design your own storefront, using code or built-in themes</li>
<li>Sell physical or digital goods and process payments through a built-in shopping cart or a third-party app</li>
<li>Maintain an online store for a reasonable price</li>
<li>Keep track of orders and shipping</li>
<li>Integrate add-ons and other tools as helpful additions to your store</li>
<li>(Roth 2016)</li></p></ul>
